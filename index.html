          This guide shows you how to create a portfolio website and upload it
          directly to Netlify. By the end of this guide, you'll have a
          functioning website that anyone with internet access can visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two versions of this guide: this one for uploading your
          portfolio directly to Netlify, and another one for using Netlify and
          GitHub. If you don't want to deal with Git, stay on this page. If you
          want to use a Git workflow and continuous deployment check out the
          <a href="./pages/netlify-and-github.html">other version</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't need to follow this guide exactly. If you know what you're
          doing, skip around. The worst thing that can happen is your site
          doesn't go live. Which means you get to troubleshoot and make it
          better. âœ¨

            In this guide, I'll use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Netlify. If
            you want to use a different text editor or other tool/service, go
            for it!

            To get started on your portfolio site, you need to the right tools.
            These are all free tools that are commonly used by professionals,
            but you don't need any experience to get started with them.

            <li>
              <p>
                Search for &quot;live server&quot; and install the Live Server

          <h3 id="create-a-local-project">Create a local project</h3>
          <p>
            Now that you have VS Code installed, it's time to set up a project.
            I put together a starter for you as a basic reference.
          </p>

          <h4>Download a GitHub project</h4>
          <ol class="procedure">
            <li>
              <p>
                Go to the
                <a href="https://github.com/bobby-pancakes/basic-portfolio"
                  >WTD-basic-portfolio</a
                >
                created by user Bobby Pancakes (an alias I created for this
                project).

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Click the green Code button, then select
                <span class="bold">Download ZIP</span>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Extract the downloaded folder somewhere on your local computer.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                In VS Code, open the downloaded project. It should look
                something like this:
              </p>
              <img
                src="./images/project.png"
                alt="Project structure"
                title="Project structure"

          <h4 id="preview-your-site-locally">Preview your site locally</h4>
          <p>
            One benefit of web development is quickly seeing how your changes
            affect your site. With the Live Server extension installed, you can
            preview your site before you upload it to GitHub. Read on to see
            how.
          </p>
          <ol class="procedure">
            <li>
              <p>
                In VS Code, right-click the
                <span class="italicize">index.html</span> file the left-hand
                navigation, then select
                <span class="bold">Open with Live Server</span>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Live Server should automatically open a new tab in your browser
                and you'll see your site. If not, enter
                <code>localhost:&#60;portNumber></code> in your browser's URL
                bar. Replace <code>&#60;portNumber></code> with the port number
                you can find in VS Code:
              </p>
              <img
                src="./images/port.png"
                alt="Live Server indicates which port you can preview your site on."
                title="Live Server port"
              />
              <p class="admonition note">
                <span class="bold">Note:</span> Typically, Live Server uses
                <code>localhost:5000</code>, but it'll be different if something
                else is using the default port. You can find your port in VS
                Code's lower-right status bar.

          <h4 id="making-the-magic">Making the magic</h4>
          <p>
            This is where you get creative. Start with the design and layout or
            write your content, then design around it. This is your portfolio,
            build it however you want. If you're not sure where to start, take a
            look at this section's resources and the

            After you've uploaded your HTML, CSS, and any other files (like
            images and sample docs), Netlify will make your site available on
            the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            To update your site, you'll need to upload all of your site's files
            again.

            Well, you did all of that work. So, how do you view it? If you
            didn't set up a custom domain name, Netlify automatically creates a
            random URL for your website. This URL won't change after it's
            assigned to your site.
