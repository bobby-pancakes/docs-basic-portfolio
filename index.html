          You don't need to follow this walkthrough exactly. If you know what
          you're doing, feel free to skip any portion. The worst thing that
          happens is your site doesn't deploy. Which means you get to
          troubleshoot and make it better.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to use a different text editor, repository host, or other
          tool/service, feel free. However, I'll only cover Visual Studio Code
          (VS Code) and Netlify in this walkthrough.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who want a simple, step-by-step guide, follow along, and
          you'll have your own website up and running quickly. No particularly
          technical skills needed and no paid tools or services recommended.

          GitHub is a git repository host. You can think of it as a sort of file

          into the details of git or GitHub in this walkthrough.

        <h4>Dowloading a GitHub project</h4>
        <ol class="procedure">
          <li>
            <p>
              Go to the
              <a href="https://github.com/bobby-pancakes/WTD-simple-portfolio"
                >WTD-simple-portfolio</a
              >
              created by user Bobby Pancakes (an alias I created for this
              project).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Click the green Code button, then select Download ZIP.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Extract the downloaded folder somewhere on your local computer.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In VS Code, open the downloaded project. It should look something
              like this:
            </p>
            <img
              src="./images/project.png"
              alt="Project structure"
              title="Project structure"
            />

        </ol>
        <h4 id="previewing-your-site-locally">Previewing your site locally</h4>
        <p>
          One benefit of web development is quickly seeing how your changes
          affect your site. With the Live Server extension installed, you can
          preview your site before you upload it to GitHub. Read on to see how.
        </p>
        <ol class="procedure">
          <li>
            <p>
              In VS Code, right-click the index.html file the left-hand
              navigation, then select <strong>Open with Live Server</strong>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Live Server should automatically open a new tab in your browser
              and you'll see your site. If not, enter
              <code>localhost:&#60;portNumber></code> in your browser's URL bar.
            </p>
            <img
              src="./images/port.png"
              alt="Live Server indicates which port you can preview your site on."
              title="Live Server port"
            />
            <p class="note">
              <strong>Note:</strong> Typically, Live Server uses
              <code>localhost:5000</code>, but if that's not available, it'll be
              different. You can find your port in VS Code's lower-right status
              bar.

          This is where you get creative. Start with the design and layout or
          write your content, then design around it. This is your portfolio,
          build it however you want. If you're not sure where to start, take a
          look at this section's resources and the

          After you've uploaded your HTML, CSS, and any other files (like images
          and sample docs), Netlify will automatically update your site.
        </p>
        <p>
          It does this by watching your GitHub repository. When there's a
          change, it automatically pulls the updated files and builds your site.

          Well, you did all of that work. So, how do you view it? If you didn't

          your site.
