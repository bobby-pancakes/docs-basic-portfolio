          This guide shows you how to create a portfolio website and use Git
          workflows with GitHub and Netlify to set up continuous Deployment. By
          the end of this guide, you'll have a functioning website that anyone
          with internet access can visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two versions of this guide: this one for using Netlify and
          GitHub, and another one for uploading your portfolio directly to
          Netlify. If you want to use a Git workflow and continuous deployment
          check stay on this page. If you don't want to deal with Git, check out
          the <a href="../index.html">other version</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't need to follow this guide exactly. If you know what you're
          doing, skip around. The worst thing that can happen is your site
          doesn't go live. Which means you get to troubleshoot and make it
          better. âœ¨

          <p>
            In this guide, I'll use Visual Studio Code (VS Code), GitHub, and
            Netlify. If you want to use a different text editor, repository
            host, or other tool/service, go for it!

          <p>
            GitHub is a git repository host. You can think of it as a sort of
            file storage service. There's a lot more to it than that, but we
            won't get into the details of git or GitHub in this guide.

            After you've uploaded your HTML, CSS, and any other files (like

          <p>
            It does this by watching your GitHub repository. When there's a

            Here are some writer portfolio examples. These are not technical
            writer portfolios. However, they all have strong design and good UX.

            I don't know any of these people. I came across their sites by
            googling for writer portfolios.
