# docs-basic-portfolio
This repository contains a small HTML and CSS website. There are no dependencies and there's nothing particularly fancy going on. Just a connection to Netflify, the website host.

## Live website
Check out the [live website](https://basic-portfolio-docs.netlify.app/) to follow along. (Unless you enjoy reading content in raw HTML form. Who am I to judge?)
